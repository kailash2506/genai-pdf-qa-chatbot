## EXP:03 Development of a PDF-Based Question-Answering Chatbot Using LangChain

### AIM:
To design and implement a question-answering chatbot capable of processing and extracting information from a provided PDF document using LangChain, and to evaluate its effectiveness by testing its responses to diverse queries derived from the document's content.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The objective is to create a chatbot that can intelligently respond to queries based on information extracted from a PDF document. By using LangChain, the chatbot will be able to process the content of the PDF and use a language model to provide relevant answers to user queries. The effectiveness of the chatbot will be evaluated by testing it with various questions related to the document.

### DESIGN STEPS:
### STEP 1: Install Required Libraries
 - To begin, we need to install the necessary libraries to work with LangChain and PDF extraction.

bash
```
pip install langchain openai PyMuPDF
```

### STEP 2: Set Up PDF Extraction
 - Use PyMuPDF (also known as fitz) to extract text from the provided PDF. The text from the document will be used as input for the LangChain processing pipeline.

### STEP 3: Create LangChain Components
 - Prompt Template: A well-structured prompt template will be designed that allows the model to effectively respond to questions based on the extracted PDF content.
 - Model: We'll use OpenAI's GPT models to process the query and the extracted document content.
 - Output Parser: We will parse the model's output to extract relevant answers.

### STEP 4: Implement the Chatbot Logic
 - The logic will involve loading the PDF, extracting the content, and setting up the LangChain pipeline for querying the document.

### PROGRAM:
```python
import openai
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader

# Step 1: Set OpenAI API Key


# Step 2: Load PDF and Extract Text
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path: str) -> str:
    reader = PdfReader(pdf_path)
    text = ""
    for page in reader.pages:
        text += page.extract_text()
    return text

# Step 3: Define the LangChain components
# Define the prompt template
prompt_template = """
You are a knowledgeable assistant that can answer questions based on the content of a document. 
The document content is as follows:

{document_content}

Please answer the following question:
{question}
"""

# Instantiate the LangChain Prompt Template
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=["document_content", "question"])

# Step 4: Define the Model (OpenAI GPT)
def query_pdf_content(pdf_path: str, user_query: str) -> str:
    # Extract text from the PDF
    document_content = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)
    
    # Initialize LangChain with the model and prompt
    model = OpenAI(temperature=0,openai_api_key="your-api-key")
    chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=prompt)

    # Step 5: Run the model with the document content and user query
    response = chain.run({"document_content": document_content, "question": user_query})

    return response

# Example usage
pdf_path = "/content/DSA_INDEX.pdf"  # Replace with your PDF path
user_query = "What is the main topic of the document?"

# Query the chatbot
response = query_pdf_content(pdf_path, user_query)

# Display the result
print(f"Response: {response}")
```
### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Prompt: A structured prompt template was designed to pass the document content and user query to the language model.
Model: OpenAI's GPT model was used to process the input data and provide an answer based on the document's content.
Output Parsing: The model's output is returned as the answer to the query, ensuring that it provides relevant responses based on the content extracted from the PDF.
